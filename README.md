# S04P01 Calculating Sums

This project is my solution in **C#** to the **Calculating Sums** practice found in section 04 practice 01 of the UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation course.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output pane.

#### PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS

###### **Calculate the sum in 2 Excel files**

Calculate the sum of the values from two columns in an Excel file in 3 ways. Create a workflow that adds the values on column A with values on column B and writes them in column C in different ways:

1. Keeps the Excel open and writes the results in real time, row by row so you can see the changes;
2. Keeps the Excel closed, set the column values in the memory DataTable and adds all the table to a new Excel files at once, in the end;
3. Calculates the sum by using Excel formulas in the original file.

**Note**: Use the Sample Columns.xlsx file below as the input file for this exercise.
